# secure-app
Spring Security demo

Essentially this is a spring boot secured app which requires a very unique username (user) and a very secret password (password) to log in.
The log in function allows you to see the greeting which otherwise is forbidden!

    ./gradlew clean build
    ./gradlew bootRun
